                An English Speaking Club is one of the best ways to improve Spoken English. Our club allows English
                language learners to practice speaking in an informal, relaxed environment. English Language
                teachers Guțu Ludmila and Magu Elena are the initiators and coordinators of the English Speaking
                Club "Speak to Lead". If you are looking to get fluency in English and gain confidence, our club is
                a great place to start practicing. Improving spoken English is all about practice. The more time you
                can spend everyday speaking in English, the faster you will improve
            </p>

                We're all in this together to create a welcoming environment. Let's treat everyone with respect. Healthy
                debates are natural, but kindness is required. Make sure everyone feels safe. Bullying of any kind isn't
                allowed, and degrading comments about things like race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or
                identity will not be tolerated.
